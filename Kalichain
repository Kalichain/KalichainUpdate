# 🚀 Kalichain Network Migration – August 2025

## 📢 Summary

Kalichain has successfully migrated to a new custom **Avalanche Subnet** as part of its technological upgrade and strategic alignment with Avalanche's **R9000 Program**. This upgrade brings faster transactions, reduced fees, and greater flexibility for the Kalichain ecosystem.

All wallet balances have been automatically **airdropped 1:1** on the new chain based on a pre-announced snapshot. No action is required from users.

## 🔄 Snapshot & Airdrop Details

- A snapshot of all balances was taken on the **legacy Kalichain chain** at **block height X (Aug 4, 18:00 UTC)**.
- All wallet addresses, including exchange wallets (e.g. MEXC), were replicated **1:1** on the new chain.
- Airdrops were sent directly to the **same wallet addresses** using the new network infrastructure.
- Users do **not need to take any action**.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Deposits & Withdrawals
- **Deposits on the old Kalichain chain are disabled** via RPC shutdown.
- The **legacy chain is still running** to maintain full transparency and traceability.
- **Only withdrawals from some exchanges (e.g. MEXC)** are still functional via their independent RPCs.

### Post-Snapshot Transactions
- We are monitoring all outbound transactions made **after the snapshot**.
- For example, **4 wallet withdrawals** were detected from MEXC after the snapshot — they will be manually airdropped on the new chain.
- If you made a deposit after the snapshot, **please contact the Kalichain team** with your wallet and transaction hash.
